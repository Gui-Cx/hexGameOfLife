# Hi ! 

Here is a small project I made during the week-end, because I really enjoyed the [24th day of Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/24) and wanted to have a visualisation.

I used the library SMLF, which you may install using the following command if you want to compile this : 
```
sudo apt install libsfml-dev
```

To build, simply run   
```
make
```
then run  
```
./main ./Input/in_ex
```
